# DateYourDataHackathon

# Problem Statement
Welcome to "Date Your Data"! We are excited to have you here. While you have found your date, we couldn't help but find a problem around matching!
 
Remember the excitement and nervousness when you went for work for the first time? Internship is certainly one of the most cherished moments for most of us. This weekend, we have a sponsor who help students as well as businesses meet each other and give students their first exposure to work - Internshala. The data science team at Internshala have worked with Analytics Vidhya to create this problem and release it to the community.

# About the problem
In this problem, we have provided information about various internships posted on Internshala. This includes various attributes about the internships like location, duration, start_date of internship etc. We have also provided information about the students who have applied for the internship. These include type_of_institute, current_year, academic performance of the student etc. Any student is free to apply for any internship on the portal.
 
While employers get high response to their posting, it is difficult to go through a high number of applications for the employers. They might need to go through high number of applications to shortlist the most relevant candidates. Hence an intelligent matching algorithm can help our users get better experience and enhance chances ofmeaningful profile matches.
